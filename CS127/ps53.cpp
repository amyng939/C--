//This program prints "Hello, World!" and "C++ is fun!" in two separate lines to the screen.

#include <iostream>                 //The built-in library for input/output
using namespace std;                //The names of standard definitions

int main()                          //C++ programs all have a main() function
{
  cout << "Hello, World!" << "\n";  //Print "Hello, World!" to the terminal. "\n" or endl for newline
  cout << "C++ is fun!";            //Print "C++ is fun!" to the terminal
  return 0;                         //Standard way to end function
